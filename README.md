recruitment task  

Task can be found in the java-web-developer.pdf file

### Current status
For this day it is not fully tested and I hope very much that it somehow works

## Improvement ideas
* In task app should return total arriving baggage pieces but flight entity does not contain arrival date
* My cargo entity implementation seems off
* Maybe baggage pieces and flight count can be done by writing appropriate query for in DB
* Customize exceptions drop Runtime, maybe add global handler
